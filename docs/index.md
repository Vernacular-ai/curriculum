# Introduction

Welcome to the Vernacular tech team's onboarding curriculum. The curriculum is a
set of guided exercises to help you get onboarded on our technology and make a
move towards delivering high quality enterprise grade AI software. It is _not_ a
reference manual, nor is it a styleguide for our tech stack.

There are four parts in the curriculum covering various aspects of building the
kind of AI software we develop. We believe the skills developed in these will
help you do your job better, irrespective of your team. Each part has various
sections, each section has few exercises to do. These exercises might require
you to read up some content which will be provided in the section itself.

!!! note 
    While there are few exercises that can be picked up independently, we
    recommend going through them sequentially.

To get started, fork this repository under your github profile. Code snippet for
starting with an exercise are provided in the `./exercises` directory in the
repository root.

Once you are ready, go [the first part on building](./building/index.md).
