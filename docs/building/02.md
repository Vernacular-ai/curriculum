# FFtrim Service

This assignment is to build an HTTP service named `fftrim-http-service` which
will be an extension to the `fftrim` [assignment][fftrim-assignment]. You'll
need to interface your `fftrim` tool via HTTP APIs so one can request these
APIs and perform the same operations as the `fftrim` CLI tool.

Here are the APIs which you can implement:

#### POST `/api/trim/`

##### Request

Following are the parameters you would need to pass to this API as query
parameters, request body etc. You can implement based on what you think would
be the best design for this API.

- `start_time`
- `end_time`
- `duration`
- `audio`

##### Response

- `audio`

You can also add any other relevant information you wish to send in the
response.

!!! note
    Audio in request/response to/from this API need to be the raw
    audio data and not an external reference to the audio file.

## Resources
Few resources that you might want to follow for working on this:
