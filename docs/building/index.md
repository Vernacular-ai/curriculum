# Building

Welcome to the building curriculum. Here we work on basic building blocks of
softwares. We will make shippable packages, CLI tools, APIs etc.

!!! note

    Majority of our software is written in Python and Golang. You can use any of
    these languages to work on the exercises. When we provide any code snippet,
    we provide language tabs like below so you can work with your preferred
    langauge.

    === "Python"

        ``` python
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print("Hello world")
        ```

    === "Go"

        ``` go
        package main

		import "fmt"

        func main() {
          fmt.Println("Hello world")
        }
        ```
