# FFtrim

Your first assignment is to build a command line tool named `fftrim` which
replicates [FFmpeg's](https://ffmpeg.org/) media trimming capabilities. FFmpeg
is versatile tool for media manipulation. If you work with speech data of any
sort, you will be sleeping happily in nights knowing that FFmpeg exists.

In `fftrim`, we want to minimally replicate audio trimming feature that works
like the following:

``` shell
fftrim -i <input-file> -ss <start-time> -to <end-time> <output-file>
fftrim -i <input-file> -ss <start-time> -t <duration> <output-file>

# All time units are in seconds
```

Few notes on the assignment:

- Your CLI tool should be installable via your language's standard method and
  provide a command in shell post installation.
- `fftrim` should preserve the audio format and encoding.
- Do not call `ffmpeg` as subprocess. The idea is for you to understand as much
  as possible about audio data representation so try reading the input using a
  decoding library and work from there.

!!! note

    Since this is merely an instructional program, don't put the package on public
    package indices like [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Instead, just provide
    instructions on building and installing the package system wide for usage.

Once you have built the package, run the test cases to ensure that your program
does what it's supposed to do. You can run tests by running `make test` in the
exercise root.

!!! warning

    Tests for this exercise are not working as of now. You are encouraged to listen
    to the generated audios to see if the tool is working as expected. Also feel
    free to do a pull request for fixing the tests.
